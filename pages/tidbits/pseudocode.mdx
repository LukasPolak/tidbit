# Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps of the algorithm. Pseudocode often uses a typical programming language's structural conventions but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. It typically omits details essential for machine understanding of the algorithm, such as variable declarations and language-specific code.
